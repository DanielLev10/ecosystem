BLOCKCHAIN REBUILT FOR SCALE. 710,000 tx/s with off-the-shelf hardware and no sharding. Scales with Moores Law.

Proof of History: The Key to Speed. Similar to Google’s TrueTime, which relies on synchronized atomic clocks for a trusted source of time and ordering, Solana has created a cryptographically secure and trustless time source--and built a blockchain around it. We call it Proof of History.

By weaving this standardized timestamp into the blockchain, nodes in the network can verify the time and order of events without witnessing them directly. This drastically reduces messaging overhead and is one example of the many optimization capabilities that become available through Solana’s Proof of History.
